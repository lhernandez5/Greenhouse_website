# HTML_Greenhouse_website
I am learning HTML5. I'm working on a website that is designed to present to the user the inventory that is available for a greenhouse business. The name of the website is The Hernandez Greenhouse. In addition to showing the inventory it also provides care tips for the plants that are available to be sold.
